\section*{Side-Chain Entropy in Protein Design}
\label{sec:side_chain_entropy_in_protein_design}
Another approach to the question of side-chain entropy, and one that has only become feasible with recent advances, is to look at its role in the \emph{de novo} design of proteins.

	\item Review logic
	\item Background on method
	\item Summarize conclusions
	\item Compare to new paper with contradictory results
