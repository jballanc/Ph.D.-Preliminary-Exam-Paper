\section*{How Important Is Side-Chain Entropy?}
\label{sec:how_important_is_side_chain_entropy_}
With the possibility that side-chain entropy may be important for some aspects of protein folding and not for others, it is vital that we understand better the roles that side-chain entropy plays.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mechanical experiment for validation
	\item New techniques for simulating proteins
\end{itemize}
