Entropy is the most complicated of the thermodynamic and energetic parameters that might affect how proteins fold. More than being an academic exercise, questions about the role that the entropy of amino acid side chains plays in the structure and function of proteins are vital to a complete understanding of biology. After all, entropy is one property which is sure to be unique to each amino acid and thus is a candidate for explaining strict amino acid preferences at certain protein sites. At the same time, proteins seem to be able to fold reasonably well while tolerating fairly large variations in their amino acid sequence. Most likely, side-chain entropy is a part of the whole but not, on its own, a key determining factor in understanding protein shape.
