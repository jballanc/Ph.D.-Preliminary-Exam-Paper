title = {Computational protein design with side-chain conformational entropy},
abstract = {Recent advances in modeling protein structures at the atomic level have made it possible to tackle "de novo" computational protein design. Most procedures are based on combinatorial optimization using a scoring function that estimates the folding free energy of a protein sequence on a given main-chain structure. However, the computation of the conformational entropy in the folded state is generally an intractable problem, and its contribution to the free energy is not properly evaluated. In this article, we propose a new automated protein design methodology that incorporates such conformational entropy based on statistical mechanics principles. We define the free energy of a protein sequence by the corresponding partition function over rotamer states. The free energy is written in variational form in a pairwise approximation and minimized using the Belief Propagation algorithm. In this way, a free energy is associated to each amino acid sequence: we use this insight to rescore the results obtained with a standard minimization method, with the energy as the cost function. Then, we set up a design method that directly uses the free energy as a cost function in combination with a stochastic search in the sequence space. We validate the methods on the design of three superficial sites of a small SH3 domain, and then apply them to the complete redesign of 27 proteins. Our results indicate that accounting for entropic contribution in the score function affects the outcome in a highly nontrivial way, and might improve current computational design techniques based on protein stability.

Protein design major goal...
	- Computational complexity determined by level of detail
	- Should use free energy, which means calculating entropy
	- Vibrational entropy a wash; conformational and solvation entropy matter
	- Solvation solved by use of solvation free energies in defining energy
Computing conformational entropy is difficult!
	- Current design uses single residue terms
	- Either mean-field technique or empirical

title = {Urea and guanidinium chloride denature protein L in different ways in molecular dynamics simulations},
abstract = {In performing protein-denaturation experiments, it is common to employ different kinds of denaturants interchangeably. We make use of molecular dynamics simulations of Protein L in water, in urea, and in guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) to ascertain if there are any structural differences in the associated unfolding processes. The simulation of proteins in solutions of GdmCl is complicated by the large number of charges involved, making it difficult to set up a realistic force field. Furthermore, at high concentrations of this denaturant, the motion of the solvent slows considerably. The simulations show that the unfolding mechanism depends on the denaturing agent: in urea the beta-sheet is destabilized first, whereas in GdmCl, it is the alpha-helix. Moreover, whereas urea interacts with the protein accumulating in the first solvation shell, GdmCl displays a longer-range electrostatic effect that does not perturb the structure of the solvent close to the protein.},

A variety of experimental and computational studies have identified energy transport channels traversing many residues, in some cases connecting functional regions, potentially important in allostery, and in other cases having no apparent function. This property and the diffusion of energy in proteins are mimicked by transport on a percolation cluster. I review work that addresses connections between globular proteins, percolation clusters, and the similarity of energy flow and thermal transport in these systems. I also review experimental and theoretical studies of the anisotropic flow of energy through the vibrational states of a protein, a property that also can be understood by comparison with simple model disordered systems.},

Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications. The structures of small proteins are now often well predicted by computer methods. And, there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from peptide fragments, local structures first.},

title = {Entropic stabilization of proteins and its proteomic consequences},
abstract = {Evolutionary traces of thermophilic adaptation are manifest, on the whole-genome level, in compositional biases toward certain types of amino acids. However, it is sometimes difficult to discern their causes without a clear understanding of underlying physical mechanisms of thermal stabilization of proteins. For example, it is well-known that hyperthermophiles feature a greater proportion of charged residues, but, surprisingly, the excess of positively charged residues is almost entirely due to lysines but not arginines in the majority of hyperthermophilic genomes. All-atom simulations show that lysines have a much greater number of accessible rotamers than arginines of similar degree of burial in folded states of proteins. This finding suggests that lysines would preferentially entropically stabilize the native state. Indeed, we show in computational experiments that arginine-to-lysine amino acid substitutions result in noticeable stabilization of proteins. We then hypothesize that if evolution uses this physical mechanism as a complement to electrostatic stabilization in its strategies of thermophilic adaptation, then hyperthermostable organisms would have much greater content of lysines in their proteomes than comparably sized and similarly charged arginines. Consistent with that, high-throughput comparative analysis of complete proteomes shows extremely strong bias toward arginine-to-lysine replacement in hyperthermophilic organisms and overall much greater content of lysines than arginines in hyperthermophiles. This finding cannot be explained by genomic GC compositional biases or by the universal trend of amino acid gain and loss in protein evolution. We discovered here a novel entropic mechanism of protein thermostability due to residual dynamics of rotamer isomerization in native state and demonstrated its immediate proteomic implications. Our study provides an example of how analysis of a fundamental physical mechanism of thermostability helps to resolve a puzzle in comparative genomics as to why amino acid compositions of hyperthermophilic proteomes are significantly biased toward lysines but not similarly charged arginines.},

Anfinsen's original experiment denaturing and renaturing RNase.

Solution may be in reach thanks to networks.

Two key questions:
	1. How? and How quickly?
	2. Shape?

Levinthal's paradox - folding not random

Folding solved in parallel.

Dill's funnel - more complicated proteins fold slower.
	- Test by mutating residues to make folding faster

2007 - Gruebele - Folded lambda-repressor faster (200x)
	- Faster folding often leads to non-functional proteins
	- "They evolved to do a job, not to fold fast"

How is mostly answered, but shape is still tough.

Two general strategies:
	1. Ab initio
	2. Homology models

New Techniques
	- NMR shifts + Prediction
	- Folding@home, Rosetta@home, GPU grids, etc.

title = {Protein design simulations suggest that side-chain conformational entropy is not a strong determinant of amino acid environmental preferences},
abstract = {Loss of side-chain conformational entropy is an important force opposing protein folding and the relative preferences of the amino acids for being buried or solvent exposed may be partially determined by which amino acids lose more side-chain entropy when placed in the core of a protein. To investigate these preferences, we have incorporated explicit modeling of side-chain entropy into the protein design algorithm, RosettaDesign. In the standard version of the program, the energy of a particular sequence for a fixed backbone depends only on the lowest energy side-chain conformations that can be identified for that sequence. In the new model, the free energy of a single amino acid sequence is calculated by evaluating the average energy and entropy of an ensemble of structures generated by Monte Carlo sampling of amino acid side-chain conformations. To evaluate the impact of including explicit side-chain entropy, sequences were designed for 110 native protein backbones with and without the entropy model. In general, the differences between the two sets of sequences are modest, with the largest changes being observed for the longer amino acids: methionine and arginine. Overall, the identity between the designed sequences and the native sequences does not increase with the addition of entropy, unlike what is observed when other key terms are added to the model (hydrogen bonding, Lennard-Jones energies, and solvation energies). These results suggest that side-chain conformational entropy has a relatively small role in determining the preferred amino acid at each residue position in a protein.},

abstract = {The role of side-chain entropy (SCE) in protein folding has long been speculated about but is still not fully understood. Utilizing a newly developed Monte Carlo method, we conducted a systematic investigation of how the SCE relates to the size of the protein and how it differs among a protein's X-ray, NMR, and decoy structures. We estimated the SCE for a set of 675 nonhomologous proteins, and observed that there is a significant SCE for both exposed and buried residues for all these proteins-the contribution of buried residues approaches approximately 40% of the overall SCE. Furthermore, the SCE can be quite different for structures with similar compactness or even similar conformations. As a striking example, we found that proteins' X-ray structures appear to pack more "cleverly" than their NMR or decoy counterparts in the sense of retaining higher SCE while achieving comparable compactness, which suggests that the SCE plays an important role in favouring native protein structures. By including a SCE term in a simple free energy function, we can significantly improve the discrimination of native protein structures from decoys.},

title = {A backbone-based theory of protein folding},
abstract = {Under physiological conditions, a protein undergoes a spontaneous disorder order transition called "folding." The protein polymer is highly flexible when unfolded but adopts its unique native, three-dimensional structure when folded. Current experimental knowledge comes primarily from thermodynamic measurements in solution or the structures of individual molecules, elucidated by either x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. From the former, we know the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy differences between the folded and unfolded forms of hundreds of proteins under a variety of solvent/cosolvent conditions. From the latter, we know the structures of approximately 35,000 proteins, which are built on scaffolds of hydrogen-bonded structural elements, alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Anfinsen showed that the amino acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine a protein's structure, but the molecular mechanism responsible for self-assembly remains an open question, probably the most fundamental open question in biochemistry. This perspective is a hybrid: partly review, partly proposal. First, we summarize key ideas regarding protein folding developed over the past half-century and culminating in the current mindset. In this view, the energetics of side-chain interactions dominate the folding process, driving the chain to self-organize under folding conditions. Next, having taken stock, we propose an alternative model that inverts the prevailing side-chain/backbone paradigm. Here, the energetics of backbone hydrogen bonds dominate the folding process, with preorganization in the unfolded state. Then, under folding conditions, the resultant fold is selected from a limited repertoire of structural possibilities, each corresponding to a distinct hydrogen-bonded arrangement of alpha-helices and/or strands of beta-sheet.},

Here, based on the known experimental data and using theoretical modeling of protein folding, we demonstrate that there exists an optimal relationship between the average conformational entropy and the average energy of contacts per residue-that is, an entropy capacity-for fast protein folding. Statistical analysis of conformational entropy and number of contacts per residue for 5829 protein structures from four general structural classes (all-alpha, all-beta, alpha/beta, alpha+beta) demonstrates that each class of proteins has its own class-specific average number of contacts (class alpha/beta has the largest number of contacts) and average conformational entropy per residue (class all-alpha has the largest number of rotatable angles phi, psi, and chi per residue). These class-specific features determine the folding rates: alpha proteins are the fastest folding proteins, then follow beta and alpha+beta proteins, and finally alpha/beta proteins are the slowest ones. Our result is in agreement with the experimental folding rates for 60 proteins. This suggests that structural and sequence properties are important determinants of protein folding rates.},

title = {How do chemical denaturants affect the mechanical folding and unfolding of proteins?},
abstract = {We present the first single-molecule atomic force microscopy study on the effect of chemical denaturants on the mechanical folding/unfolding kinetics of a small protein GB1 (the B1 immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G from Streptococcus). Upon increasing the concentration of the chemical denaturant guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), we observed a systematic decrease in the mechanical stability of GB1, indicating the softening effect of the chemical denaturant on the mechanical stability of proteins. This mechanical softening effect originates from the reduced free-energy barrier between the folded state and the unfolding transition state, which decreases linearly as a function of the denaturant concentration. Chemical denaturants, however, do not alter the mechanical unfolding pathway or shift the position of the transition state for mechanical unfolding. We also found that the folding rate constant of GB1 is slowed down by GdmCl in mechanical folding experiments. By combining the mechanical folding/unfolding kinetics of GB1 in GdmCl solution, we developed the "mechanical chevron plot" as a general tool to understand how chemical denaturants influence the mechanical folding/unfolding kinetics and free-energy diagram in a quantitative fashion. This study demonstrates great potential in combining chemical denaturation with single-molecule atomic force microscopy techniques to reveal invaluable information on the energy landscape underlying protein folding/unfolding reactions.},
